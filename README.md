# Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling: Illustrative Examples of Different Modeling Approaches

This repository illustrates different types of models that have been used in the Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling (MSEM) literature. Specifically, this repository covers:
- [Doubly Manifest Models](timms_manifest.R)
- Manifest-Measurement/Latent-Aggregation Models
- Latent-Measurement/Manifest-Aggregation Models
- Doubly Latent Models
