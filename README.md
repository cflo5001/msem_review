# Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling: Illustrative Examples of Different Modeling Approaches

This repository illustrates different types of models that have been used in the Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling (MSEM) literature. Specifically, this repository covers:
- [Doubly Manifest Models](timss_manifest.R)
- [Manifest-Measurement/Latent-Aggregation Models](timss_manlat.R)
- [Latent-Measurement/Manifest-Aggregation Models](timss_latman.R)
- Doubly Latent Models
